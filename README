[[ABANDONED]]

Columner allows you to decrease a web page width, without changing a browser's window size, simply with mouse wheel or keyboard shortcuts.
This makes easier to read text blocks that are too wide.

TODO:

Current bugs:

    - preferences:
        shift+wheel starts working only after a second (shift+alt+U|L) option had enabled.
        After disabling the second option hotkeys still working.

    - if close and open a tab with same url, doesn't work any more


New version:

    1. column align option (left|center|right)
    2. remember page width for url/domain
    3. change keyboard shortcuts (current overrides some defaults).
